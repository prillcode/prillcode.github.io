## Aaron Prill - Sr. Software Engineer
**Tyler Technologies**

Hired in 2004

Lover of C#, T-SQL, and currently learning all things Amazon Web Services as our company heads full-steam into the cloud. 

Still maintaining an enterprise-level VB6 app (ya, that's Visual Basic 6.0 from the dark ages) as we transition clients to a new Tyler software solution.

```csharp
/* Each day is like a code block...
   ...You can see what is happening clearly as long as there is a definite beginning an end.
*/
if (good_night_sleep == true) {
  HaveProductiveDay();
}
else {
  BrainFog = true;
}

```
