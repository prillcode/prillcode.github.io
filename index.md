## Technology Stack

Lover of C#, T-SQL, Git/Github (of course), and currently learning all things Amazon Web Services as our company heads full-steam into the cloud. 

Still maintaining an enterprise-level VB6 app (ya, that's Visual Basic 6.0 from the dark ages) as we transition clients to a new Tyler software solution (Read more about [my work experience](/work)).

```csharp
/* Each day is like a code block...
   ...You can see what is happening clearly as long as there is a definite beginning and a definite end.
*/
if (good_night_sleep == true) {
  HaveProductiveDay();
}
else {
  BrainFog = true;
}
